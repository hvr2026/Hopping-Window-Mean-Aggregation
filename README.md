# Hopping Window Aggregation for Sensor Data Processing

This repository demonstrates how to use a hopping window function to aggregate mean values of sensor readings in a simulated time-series dataset. Hopping windows are useful for analyzing streaming data, such as sensor readings in enterprise distributed environments, to improve throughput and reduce latency.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

In enterprise distributed systems, sensor systems generate continuous data (e.g., temperature readings). To handle this data efficiently, hopping windows are applied to compute overlapping aggregates, enabling real-time insights and robust trend analysis.

This project:
- Simulates a time-series dataset representing hourly sensor readings.
- Applies a hopping window function to compute the rolling mean.
- Visualizes the original data and the hopping window means using line plots.

## 🛠️ **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local system:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hopping-window-aggregation.git
cd hopping-window-aggregation
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📜 **Usage**

Run the Python script to execute the hopping window aggregation and visualize the results.

### 1. Execute the script
```bash
python hopping_window_demo.py
```

### 2. Output
- The script will generate a time-series dataset.
- It applies a 3-hour hopping window with a 1-hour hop interval.
- A line plot will display:
  - **Original Data**: Raw sensor readings.
  - **Hopping Mean**: Aggregated rolling means using the hopping window.

---

## 🧪 **Code Explanation**

The main script, `hopping_window_demo.py`, performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Generates a synthetic time-series dataset using `pandas` and `numpy`.

2. **Hopping Window Aggregation**:
   - Computes the rolling mean over a 3-hour window with a 1-hour hop.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plots the original data and the computed hopping means.

---

## 📊 **Visualization**

The resulting plot shows:
- **Original Data**: Sensor readings as generated.
- **Hopping Mean**: Smoothed values computed using overlapping windows.

This visualization helps analyze trends in the sensor data.

## 📦 **Dependencies**

The following Python libraries are required:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔧 **Customization**

You can customize the hopping window parameters in the script:
- **Window Size**: Modify the `window_size` variable (e.g., `'3h'` for 3 hours).
- **Hop Size**: Adjust the `hop_size` variable (e.g., `'1h'` for 1 hour).
