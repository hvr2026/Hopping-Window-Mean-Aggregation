# Hopping Window Aggregation for Sensor Data Processing

This repository demonstrates how to use a hopping window function to aggregate mean values of sensor readings in a simulated time-series dataset. Hopping windows are useful for analyzing streaming data, such as sensor readings in enterprise distributed environments, to improve throughput and reduce latency.

## **Project Overview**

In enterprise distributed systems, sensor systems generate continuous data (e.g., temperature readings). To handle this data efficiently, hopping windows are applied to compute overlapping aggregates, enabling real-time insights and robust trend analysis.

This project:
- Simulates a time-series dataset representing hourly sensor readings.
- Applies a hopping window function to compute the rolling mean.
- Visualizes the original data and the hopping window means using line plots.
